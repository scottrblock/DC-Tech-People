  Taking a look at AngelList Data
%p
  = link_to "AngelList", "http://angel.co" 
  is a social network that connects startups with investors. They provide an API to access their data, which we dive into below:
%p
  There are
  %strong.total-people
    = total_users_from_source("AngelList")
  people on AngelList who claim to live in the Washington DC region. They have DC listed as either their first or only location.
%p
  We use 
  = link_to "Genderize.io", "http://genderize.io"
  to predict if a user is male or female. If their data determines someone's
  first name to have a 75% or higher probability of a given gender, we
  include them in our analysis.
%p
  Genderize.io determined the gender with at least 75% probability for
  %strong.total-people-with-gender
    = total_users_that_have_gender('AngelList')
  people.
%p
  Of the 
  = total_users_that_have_gender('AngelList')
  people analyzed,
  %strong.number-females
    = pluralize(num_gender('female', 'AngelList'), 'was', 'were')
    female
  and
  %strong.number-males

    male
  \:
